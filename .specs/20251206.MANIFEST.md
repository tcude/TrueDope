# TrueDope v2 - Project Manifest

**Created**: December 6, 2024
**Status**: Planning
**Goal**: Complete rewrite with unified session-based architecture, modern React frontend, and improved UX

---

## Executive Summary

TrueDope v1 was built as a DOPE recording tool and grew organically to include velocity and group tracking. This resulted in two parallel, disconnected recording systems (`ShootingRecord` for DOPE, `ShootingString` for velocity/groups) with duplicated metadata and a clunky user experience.

TrueDope v2 introduces a **session-first architecture** where a single `RangeSession` entity serves as the anchor, with DOPE, chrono, and group data as optional children. This fundamental model change, combined with a React frontend rewrite, will deliver a cleaner UX and more maintainable codebase.

---

## What's Changing

### Data Model
| v1 | v2 | Change |
|----|----|----|
| `ShootingRecord` | `RangeSession` | Unified session concept |
| `ShootingString` | `ChronoSession` | Clearer naming, child of RangeSession |
| `DistanceHold` | `DopeEntry` | Child of RangeSession |
| `GroupData` | `GroupEntry` | No longer nested under chrono |
| `IndividualShot` | `VelocityReading` | Clearer naming |
| `SessionType` enum | Removed | Replaced by presence of child data |
| Dual ammo system | Linked only | Remove legacy manual ammo fields |

### Technology Stack

|-----------|----|----|
| Backend | ASP.NET Core 8 + Razor Pages | ASP.NET Core 8 API only |
| Frontend | Razor Pages (server-rendered) | React + Vite + Tailwind |
| Database | PostgreSQL 15 | PostgreSQL 15 (new schema) |
| Object Storage | MinIO | MinIO (evaluate alternatives later) |
| Mobile | Swift/SwiftUI (in progress) | Swift/SwiftUI (update for new API) |

---

### Phase 12: Data Import from v1
Migrate personal data from v1 to v2.

- Write import script to parse v1 JSON exports:
  - `rifles.json` → `RifleSetup`
  - `ammunition.json` → `Ammunition`
  - `ammo-lots.json` → `AmmoLot`
  - `locations.json` → `SavedLocation`
  - `shooting-records-full.json` → `RangeSession` + `DopeEntry[]`
  - `shooting-strings-full.json` → `RangeSession` + `ChronoSession` + `GroupEntry[]`
- Handle data mapping and transformation
- Validate imported data
- Run import for personal data
- Verify data integrity

**Deliverable**: v1 data successfully migrated to v2

---

### Phase 13: iOS App Updates
Update the existing Swift/SwiftUI app for the new API.

- Update API client for new endpoints
- Update data models to match new schema:
  - `RangeSession` replaces `ShootingRecord` and `ShootingString`
  - New `DopeEntry`, `ChronoSession`, `GroupEntry` models
- Update ViewModels for new data flow
- Update session recording views:
  - Unified session creation flow
  - Dynamic sections for DOPE/Chrono/Groups
- Update session list and detail views
- Update analytics views for new API
- Test all flows end-to-end
- Handle unit preferences from API

**Deliverable**: iOS app fully functional with v2 backend

---

### Bonus Phase 1: Bug Fixes
Bug Fixing Time

- JWT is still kinda funky in the iOS app.  I can open the app and it seems like, upon my first time querying data, the app realizes it needs to take me back to the login page
- Sessions
  - In the iOS app, "Failed to load locations" shows up when starting a new session under the "Location" section, under "Use Current Location" and "Browse Shared Locations" BUT, upon clicking on "Use Current Location", everything works correctly.
- We should ditch the shared locations feature. It was meant to be more of a kind of thing where I could put default locations in there and share it, as an admin, with certain users, rather than it being a distinctly separate thing than setting custom locations.
- Windage should be entirely optional.  This will require modifications to both the webapp and the ios app
- For some reason, I can no longer pull up Swagger in my web browser
- DOPE charts work! Although, they seem to only let me view a single DOPE chart for a rifle, with no ability to filter by ammo type.  DOPE charts likely vary wildly depending on what ammo is being used.  Neither the webapp nor the iOS app seem to respect this currently, though they do allow for filtering by environmental conditions, date, etc. 



---

### Phase 14: Deployment & Launch
Final deployment and go-live.

- Provision new VM for v2
- Configure production environment
- Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- Configure production database
- Configure production MinIO
- Deploy application
- Run data import on production
- Smoke test all features
- Monitor for issues
- Decommission v1 (optional, can keep as archive)

**Deliverable**: v2 live in production

---

### Phase 15: Implement monitoring and observability
Begin exporting data so that it can be visualized in Grafana and Splunk

- This needs to be fleshed out more but I would like to get data visualized in Grafana to see usage stats, failures, etc
- It might be worth utilizing Splunk for this, too
- Decide what each of these is better for

---

### Phase 16: Quick Setup / Inline Entity Creation

Reduce friction for new users by allowing inline creation of dependent entities during session recording.

- **Session Creation Flow**:
  - If user has no rifles, show inline "Create Rifle" form instead of blocking
  - "Create Rifle" sheet accessible from rifle picker during session creation
  - Minimal required fields only (name, caliber, zero distance) with option to add details later

- **Chrono Session Flow**:
  - If user has no ammunition (or none matching rifle caliber), show inline "Create Ammunition" form
  - "Create Ammunition" sheet accessible from ammo picker during chrono entry
  - Minimal required fields (manufacturer, name, caliber, grain)

- **Web App Parity**:
  - Implement same inline creation patterns in React frontend
  - Consistent UX between iOS and web

- **UX Goals**:
  - New user can go from registration to logging their first session in under 2 minutes
  - No "you must create X first" blocking flows
  - Progressive disclosure: simple forms for quick setup, full forms for detailed configuration

**Deliverable**: Streamlined onboarding experience for new users on both iOS and web

---

### Phase 17: Location UX Improvements

Simplify location management and improve the location picker experience.

- **Shared Locations Integration**:
  - Shared locations (admin-created ranges) automatically appear in all users' saved locations list
  - Remove separate "Browse Shared Locations" flow - shared locations are just part of "My Locations"
  - Shared locations marked with indicator (globe icon) but behave like saved locations

- **Simplified Location Picker**:
  - Single "My Locations" list (includes both user-saved and shared locations)
  - "Use GPS" / "New Location" option that gets current coordinates
  - Option to save GPS location with a name for future use

- **Create Location On-The-Fly**:
  - From location picker, user can tap "Use Current GPS"
  - After getting coordinates, option to "Save as Location" with name input
  - Similar pattern to Quick Setup inline entity creation

- **Web App Parity**:
  - Implement same simplified location picker in React frontend
  - Remove separate shared locations browser
  - Consistent UX between iOS and web

- **Backend Changes**:
  - Endpoint to list locations that includes shared locations visible to user
  - OR modify shared locations to auto-create copies in user's saved locations

**Deliverable**: Streamlined location selection across iOS and web

## Out of Scope (Intentional)

These items are explicitly not part of v2:

- **Ballistic Calculator**: Cannot compete with dedicated tools like Applied Ballistics. Focus is on data logging and analytics.
- **Offline/PWA Support**: Noted for future consideration, not v2.
- **Android App**: iOS only for now. React Native migration is a future consideration.
- **Social Features**: No sharing, no public profiles, no community features.
- **Import from Other Apps**: No import from Applied Ballistics, BallisticsARC, etc.

### API Design Principles
- RESTful endpoints
- Consistent response wrapper: `{ success, data, error, message }`
- Pagination: `{ items, pagination: { currentPage, pageSize, totalItems, totalPages } }`
- JWT Bearer authentication
- Validation errors return structured error objects

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for critical business logic (velocity calculations, stats)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Manual testing for UI flows
- No e2e test framework initially (add later if needed)

## Open Questions / Future Considerations

1. **Quick Entry Mode**: Minimal "just log DOPE fast" mode for range use?
2. **Offline Support**: PWA with local storage that syncs when online?
3. **Dark Mode**: User preference for dark theme?
4. **MinIO Alternatives**: Evaluate Garage or other S3-compatible storage if MinIO maintenance mode becomes an issue?
5. **React Native**: Consider for future Android support and potential iOS rewrite?
