## 12. Remove Dashboard Diagnostic Logging
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Type:** iOS Cleanup | **Status:** Pending

Temporary diagnostic logging was added to investigate the "Add Your First Rifle" empty state appearing incorrectly for users who already have rifles.

**Files to clean up:**
- `TrueDope-iOS/TrueDope-iOS/Core/Utilities/Config.swift` - Remove `Log.diagnostic()` method
- `TrueDope-iOS/TrueDope-iOS/ViewModels/DashboardViewModel.swift` - Remove `Log.diagnostic()` calls in `loadDashboard()`

**When to remove:** After confirming the fix in DashboardView.swift resolves the issue (requires user feedback or logs showing the root cause).

**Related fix:** Changed empty state condition in `DashboardView.swift` from `!viewModel.hasRifles` to `viewModel.hasLoadedInitialData, let summary = viewModel.summary, !summary.hasRifles` to prevent showing empty state when API fails.

## ✅ 13. iOS Password Validation Mismatch
**Difficulty:** Medium | **Type:** iOS Bug | **Status:** FIXED

Users report that "optional" password requirements are being enforced as mandatory during registration, causing validation errors.

**Root Cause Investigation Needed:**
- iOS client (`RegisterViewModel.swift`) only requires 8+ characters - optional requirements (uppercase, lowercase, number, special char) are UI strength indicators only
- Backend may have stricter validation that rejects passwords without these characters
- Need to verify backend password requirements in `AuthController.cs` or `AuthService.cs`

**Files to investigate:**
- `TrueDope-iOS/TrueDope-iOS/Features/Auth/RegisterViewModel.swift` - Client validation (lines 108-111 only check `hasMinLength`)
- `TrueDope-iOS/TrueDope-iOS/Features/Auth/RegisterView.swift` - UI shows optional labels (lines 214-236)
- `TrueDope/backend/src/TrueDope.Api/` - Backend registration validation

**Fix options:**
1. Update iOS UI to show backend's actual requirements as required (not optional)
2. Relax backend validation to match iOS's optional approach
3. Sync both to consistent requirements

**Resolution:** Updated iOS to match backend requirements:
- `RegisterView.swift`: Changed uppercase, lowercase, and number from optional to required; kept special character as optional
- `RegisterViewModel.swift`: Updated `isPasswordValid` to check `hasMinLength && hasUppercase && hasLowercase && hasNumber`

## ✅ 14. iOS FAQ Page Not Found
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Type:** iOS/Web Bug | **Status:** FIXED

FAQ page doesn't exist - iOS links to `https://truedope.io/faq` which returns 404.

**Current implementation:**
- `TrueDope-iOS/TrueDope-iOS/Features/Settings/AboutView.swift` (lines 61-65) links to external FAQ URL
- No `/faq` route exists in web frontend

**Fix:** Create FAQ page in web frontend at `TrueDope/frontend/src/pages/legal/FAQ.tsx` and add route in `App.tsx`

**Resolution:** Created FAQ page with sections covering Getting Started, Recording Data, Managing Equipment, Data & Privacy, Premium Features, and Technical Questions. Added `/faq` route to App.tsx as a public legal page.

## 15. Create Support Email Address
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Type:** Infrastructure | **Status:** Pending

Create `support@truedope.io` email address.

**Currently referenced in:**
- `TrueDope-iOS/TrueDope-iOS/Features/Settings/AboutView.swift` (lines 55-59) - mailto link

---

## 16. Create Privacy Email Address
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Type:** Infrastructure | **Status:** Pending

Create `privacy@truedope.io` email address.

**Currently referenced in:**
- `TrueDope/frontend/src/pages/legal/PrivacyPolicy.tsx` (line 197)

---

## ✅ 17. Create Terms of Service Page
**Difficulty:** Medium | **Type:** Web/Legal | **Status:** FIXED

Terms of Service page doesn't exist - iOS links to `https://truedope.io/terms` which likely returns 404.

**Current state:**
- Privacy Policy fully implemented at `TrueDope/frontend/src/pages/legal/PrivacyPolicy.tsx`
- No Terms of Service page exists
- iOS `AboutView.swift` links to `/terms`

**Fix:** Create ToS page at `TrueDope/frontend/src/pages/legal/TermsOfService.tsx` following PrivacyPolicy.tsx structure.

**Content to cover:**
- Service description (freemium ballistics data logging platform)
- User accounts and responsibilities
- Acceptable use policy
- Data ownership and licensing
- Disclaimers (not liable for shooting outcomes, ballistic calculations, etc.)
- Termination conditions
- Governing law

**Resolution:** Created Terms of Service page with all required sections including service description, user accounts, acceptable use, data ownership, disclaimers (with shooting liability), limitation of liability, termination, changes to terms, and governing law. Added `/terms` route to App.tsx as a public legal page.

## 18. Create Dummy Data Script
**Difficulty:** Medium | **Type:** Backend Tooling | **Status:** Pending

Configurable script to generate test data for non-shooter testers who want to help test the app.

**Implementation:** Backend API script (shell script with curl) that:
- Accepts parameters to control data volume (minimal, moderate, full)
- Creates via API endpoints (not direct DB access) for realistic testing
- Generates: rifles, ammunition, locations, sessions with DOPE/chrono/groups

**Suggested location:** `TrueDope/backend/scripts/seed-demo-data.sh`

**Data to generate (configurable):**
- Minimal: 1 rifle, 2 ammo types, 1 location, 3 sessions
- Moderate: 3 rifles, 5 ammo types, 2 locations, 10 sessions
- Full: 5 rifles, 10 ammo types, 5 locations, 20 sessions with varied DOPE/chrono/group entries

**Possible Implementation Idea:**
- Make the script simply clone the data from my user (tanneracude@gmail.com) to whatever user I want to use as a test account. It should copy the images and whatnot over, too
