## 12. Remove Dashboard Diagnostic Logging
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Type:** iOS Cleanup | **Status:** Pending

Temporary diagnostic logging was added to investigate the "Add Your First Rifle" empty state appearing incorrectly for users who already have rifles.

**Files to clean up:**
- `TrueDope-iOS/TrueDope-iOS/Core/Utilities/Config.swift` - Remove `Log.diagnostic()` method
- `TrueDope-iOS/TrueDope-iOS/ViewModels/DashboardViewModel.swift` - Remove `Log.diagnostic()` calls in `loadDashboard()`

**When to remove:** After confirming the fix in DashboardView.swift resolves the issue (requires user feedback or logs showing the root cause).

**Related fix:** Changed empty state condition in `DashboardView.swift` from `!viewModel.hasRifles` to `viewModel.hasLoadedInitialData, let summary = viewModel.summary, !summary.hasRifles` to prevent showing empty state when API fails.
