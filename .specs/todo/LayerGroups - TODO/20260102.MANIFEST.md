# Insert here summary of what to do
# The goal of this manifest will be to allow multiple groups (3 groups of 5, for example) to be overlaid to give a better idea of the true accuracy of a rifle

# Additionally, it would be neat to take the total aggregate groups of a rifle (ideally for a particular ammo type, or even down to the lot) to see how the rifle overall's accuracy is.  Filtering could be included based off of weather conditions but that would likely be overkill
