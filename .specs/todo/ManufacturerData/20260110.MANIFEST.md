# Manufacturer Data - Strategic Initiative

**Created:** January 10, 2026
**Status:** Future/Strategic
**Type:** Business Development
**Difficulty:** Hard (non-technical)

---

## Overview

Position the app to provide valuable anonymized aggregate data for:
- Ammo manufacturers
- Barrel/rifle manufacturers

---

## Data Strategy: Anonymized Aggregates

- No individual user data shared
- Statistical trends across user base (e.g., "average velocity for Federal GMM 77gr across 1,000+ users")
- Requires sufficient user base to be statistically meaningful

---

## Potential Data Points

- Velocity statistics by ammo type (mean, SD, ES)
- Velocity vs barrel length correlations
- Group size distributions by ammo/rifle combo
- Popular rifle/ammo pairings
- Regional usage patterns (anonymized)

---

## Privacy Considerations

- Clear privacy policy about aggregate data use
- Possibly opt-out option for users who don't want to contribute
- No PII ever included in aggregates

---

## Business Model Options

- Sell reports/dashboards to manufacturers
- Partner with manufacturers for sponsored ammo database entries
- Offer "verified by TrueDope" badge for manufacturer claims

---

## Why This Is Hard

Not technically hard, but requires:
- Sufficient user base
- Business development with manufacturers
- Legal/privacy review
- Data pipeline infrastructure
- Dashboard/reporting tools

This is a long-term strategic initiative.

## Prerequisites

1. Grow user base to statistically meaningful size
2. Legal review of data sharing policies
3. Dashboard/reporting infrastructure
